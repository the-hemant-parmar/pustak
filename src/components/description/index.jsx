                I am a curious person. I am good at understanding topics in
                depth. I have good practice in developing websites where my
                focus was more on the backend. I have very good fundamental
                knowledge about the working of different services and
                applications. I also know machine learning and deep learning,
                especially computer vision. I am very comfortable designing and
                working with databases. I will be very helpful as an intern to
                the company.
